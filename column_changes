"If a scalar is desired where normally a list would be present, such as a bi-directional one-to-one relationship, set relationship.uselist to False." 
This is the case in the Company class with the relations to Supplier and Manufacturer. I do not know what that means. :) What is a scalar and why do we want it instead of a list? /Johanna

addresses:
address_type_id -> fk and nn Done!
company_id -> fk and nn Done!

companies:
add foreign key address_id Done! (Added corresponding relationship in Address)
(contact -> contact_first_name and contact_last_name??)

customers:
add email address?

customer_cars:
license_number INT -> VARCHAR(6) - DONE (but not shared in a dump yet)!

manufacturers:
manufacturer_id -> add auto_increment

spare_parts:
product_number -> add auto_increment (fk constraints)
description varchar(250) -> varchar(45)

suppliers:
supplier_id -> add auto_increment
company_id -> fk

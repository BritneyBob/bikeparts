* Decide whether we should name our classes in singular or plural.
* Add relationships where missing.

addresses:
address_type_id -> fk and nn
company_id -> fk and nn
In our db, address_line 1 and 2 are nullable but not in the code. Discuss how we want this and make corresponding changes.

companies:
add foreign key address_id
(contact -> contact_first_name and contact_last_name??)

customers:
add email address?

customer_cars:
license_number INT -> VARCHAR(6) - DONE!

manufacturers:
manufacturer_id -> add auto_increment

spare_parts:
product_number -> add auto_increment (fk constraints)
description varchar(250) -> varchar(45)

suppliers:
supplier_id -> add auto_increment
company_id -> fk

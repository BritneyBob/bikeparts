"If a scalar is desired where normally a list would be present, such as a bi-directional one-to-one relationship, set relationship.uselist to False." 
This is the case in the Company class with the relations to Supplier and Manufacturer. I do not know what that means. :) What is a scalar and why do we want it instead of a list? /Johanna

addresses:
address_type_id -> fk and nn DONE DONE 
remove company_id DONE DONE

create new table:
companies_has_addresses -> FK company_id and FK address_id DONE DONE 
P.S. The two foreign keys in this table does not start with fk_ as usual but I think they will work anyway.
If they don't, let me know and I will change it! /Johanna 
P.P.S. I have not included Base.metadata in the table since it seems to relate only to the classes, but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong! D.S.

customers:
(add email address?)

customer_cars:
license_number INT -> VARCHAR(6) - DONE DONE

manufacturers:
manufacturer_id -> add auto_increment DONE DONE 

spare_parts:
product_number -> add auto_increment (fk constraints) DONE DONE 
description varchar(250) -> varchar(45) DONE DONE

suppliers:
supplier_id -> add auto_increment DONE DONE
company_id -> fk DONE DONE
